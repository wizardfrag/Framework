PHP 5.3 Framework
=================

This framework isn't really intended for public use. I just created it as a learning excercise really, in order to investigate PHP 5.3. It's most likely got some insecurities that may cause issues if you try to use it in a production environment (Hint: Don't!)

Features to be added:
* Router DSL
* Database handling
* Model handling
* View handling (through smarty or twig)
* Better controller structure

This should at least provide a basis for people to create their own frameworks or whatever.
